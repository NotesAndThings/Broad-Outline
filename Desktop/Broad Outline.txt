SORTA PLAN FOR THIS THING

STRUCTURE
	SQL DATABASE
		USERS TABLE
			Contains username, password, firs name, last name, campus,groups(foreign key to Master Group table), unique ID
		MASTER GROUP TABLE
			Contains unique ID, name of group, possible members or something, a foreign key that links to pictures table
		PICTURES TABLE (Each group has a pictures table)
			Contains group name, unique ID generated by each picture that is added
	SERVER
		Most likely going to use Google App Engine, it is free except for the SQL part. Need to find a way to host SQL database for free
		This will be the middle man between UI and the Database, will load "screen shots" to minimize traffic to SQL DB to make sure users
		don't go through a ton of data using app	
	UI
		Login Screen
			pretty basic, asks for username and password
			or sign-up button
		Sign-up Screen
			Ask for first name, last name, campus, username, password
		Main Page With Lists Of Groups
			Shows groups that have been added
			Search bar that can be used to search already created groups on the campus you are on
			Create Group Button
				used to create a new group that will be stored in the database, if user cannot find class they are looking for
		Group Page
			Possible 3 tabs (Notes, Feed, Calendar)
			Notes Tab
				Contains pictures of all notes upload
				possibly info about each picture, such as who uploaded it and what day
			Feed Tab
				People in the group can ask questions to each other regarding class and other tomfoolery
			Calendar Tab
				Calendar that can be updated by each member of Group, such as quiz dates, exam dates, etc.
